An android app that chooses a random game for you to play from your steam account.
This project uses Google's Volley framework for transmitting the requests to the
Steam web api.
The volley code can be found here: (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley)

### How It Works:
Enter the vanity url for your steam profile and press Play! A random game from a list
of games you own will appear and YOU MUST PLAY IT. The RNGods will be upset if you don't.

Got friends? Enter their vanity urls as well (up to four players) and a multiplayer game all
of you own will be chosen.

When entering your url, just enter the custom url text you set in your profile, not the
entire `http://steamcommunity.com/id/custom url`, just the `custom url` part.

### Profile Requirements:
Two things are required for each steam profile for this to work:
+ The players' steam profile be public (the api will only return a list of owned games
from a public profile)
+ A vanity url is set in each player's profile

### What is a vanity url?
A vanity url, also known as a custom url, is... well just as it says a custom url you can
enter to make navigating or linking to your steam profile easier. You can set it to whatever
you like (so long as it isn't taken) from your steam profile.

To set it, log in to steam and navigate to Edit Profile. There you should see a
listing for 'Custom URL' with a textbox. Enter whatever you like!

## Build Instructions

If you want to put this app on your phone you will need to put the phone into developer mode,
and also may need to allow apps from untrusted sources to run. See your phone's instructions
on how to do that, as it varies by Android version.

### Clone and Build

You'll need an api key from Steam. You can acquire one [here](https://steamcommunity.com/dev).
To acquire an api key you may need to create a Steam account, if you don't already have one.

This project was built using Android Studio, so I'm assuming you're using that as well. If not,
please follow the build instructions for your IDE.

First, clone this repository:

`https://github.com/andrewgonzalez/ChooseAndPerish.git`

Open the project in Android Studio, and locate the ApiKey.java file. Enter your api key
for the API_KEY variable.

Build the project, then run it on your device (whether that be an Android Virtual Device
or a phone attached via usb). That's it!

## Project Goals

This is more like a to do list rather than a broad statement about the philosophical
direction I want the app to take.

#### Short Term:

I wrote this out after I'd had the project pretty well built (the app is working at least).
So these are just things I'd like to work on immediately to make the app feel more complete.

+ Add a service so the app can run in the background
+ ~~Only return multiplayer games when there are multiple players entered~~  Done
+ Make the UI prettier

#### Stretch Goals:
+ Put it on the Google Play store as a free app?
+ Cache lists of owned games for repeat requests
+ Improve memory performance (getting quite a few gc\_for\_alloc during all the store calls)
